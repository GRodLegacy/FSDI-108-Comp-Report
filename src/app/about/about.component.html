<h1>About me, the Dev</h1>
 <p>I'm just a 27 year old new dad and Navy veteran, trying development for a change. I find it very enterntaining and challenging and that's exactly what I need in a job to stick with it. I know that there is a ton of things to learn and I'm determined to become a Senior Dev.
     I live in Milwaukee, WI with my wife and 6 month old daughter whose name is Alenid. I also have a dog whose name is Loki. Like Thor's brother from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In my spare time I like to work on my car and work out. My dream car is an Audi R8 and even if it's an old one
     , I hope to buy one with a Senior Dev salary.But most importantly, I hope to buy a big enough house, in a nice enough neighborhood, and set my kids up for success in the future. I spent 3 years in college, not knowing what I wanted to study. I'm so glad that I fouund my new passion. My name is Victor Daniel Gonzalez Rodriguez and I this is my story.
